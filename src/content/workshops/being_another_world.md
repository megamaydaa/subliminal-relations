## Being Another World: a path back to somatic solidarity

At this historical moment there is a felt sense gaining momentum as the shadow side of the overculture turns belly up; a felt sense that relational culture is a spark that can never be extinguished from embodied memory. Being Another World is an invitation to honor, play with, and amplify spark into flame.

We invite you into an adaptive container for sensing the contradictions between our inherent, embodied connection to one another and the social conditions that have gotten in the way. Our dream for this workshop is to cultivate a relational field where principles of embodied healing can be experienced, not as a trademarked modality, strict protocol, or professional development pathway (though that is welcome), but as a relational ground for awareness, creative expression and building collective power. We are life-long students of self-healing life processes known by many names, accessed and mapped through diverse cultural processes. We have arrived at this offering through years of formal and informal training in body-oriented healing modalities (generative somatics, Focusing, Aston Patterning, Bodynamics, NARM), developmental theory, social neuroscience, and lived experience of extreme distress states.

Together, we will explore six relational-developmental themes: (1) Ground, (2) Reciprocity, (3) Agency, (4) Rupture and Repair, (5) Rage and Grief and (6) Somatic Solidarity. Each week we will facilitate theater games, movement scores, and awareness practices that support the development of embodied listening. Along the way, we will build new layers of support as we deepen our inquiry. Ground will focus on arriving in re-connection to the earth and our shared context through play and writing; Reciprocity will deepen into the relationship with ground, while introducing partner practices that generate a felt-sense of interpersonal support; Agency will build on that potential for interpersonal support while honoring boundary and differentiation through movement scores; Rupture and Repair deepens our reflection on where sources of support may have gone missing and provides opportunities for politicized reflection and inner relational repair; Rage and Grief builds on the psychobiological ground of the preceding weeks, inviting us to play at the edge between theatrical exaggeration and genuine sensorimotor release; Somatic Solidarity will be an opportunity to slow everything down and reflect on how we can keep our embodied learning alive outside the container of the workshop. Participants will be asked to keep an integration “journal,” which can take any form - from sketchbook to spreadsheet to recipe to sheet music. Week six will conclude with an integrative, low-stakes show and tell drawn from this journaling, as a form of culture building towards another world.

The core themes are starting points and we expect the content in each session to shift and change alongside the lived experience of the group. The level of intimacy and vulnerability will also be shaped by the group in real time, and situated within the larger process of co-creating an adaptive container to hold an expansive collective aliveness.

## Facilitator Bios

**Megan Daalder** aka Subliminal Relations is deeply committed to embodiment as a pathway to collective liberation. Their lived experience with "mental illness" and formative relationship with their neighbor Georgina, who invited them into a monthly sweat ceremony 10 years ago, continues to point them in the direction of life itself as the greatest teacher. They have training in the Neuroaffective Relational Model (NARM), Strozzi somatic bodywork, Mind-Body coaching and Internal Relationship Focusing. For the last three years they have led a group workshop called "What is a Collective Nervous System?" and offered one on one somatic coaching. They are currently working towards their MA in somatic psychotherapy. In the first half of life they were a video/performance artist deeply influenced as a performer and student of Hana Van Der Kolk. Their installation "The Mirrorbox" was studied by graduate students in Antonio Damasio's Brain and Creativity Institute as a "tool for modulating self/other perception." 

**Jacey Eve** (they/them) is a relational medicine person, ecosomatics practitioner, and healing arts theorist who has been dreaming up "teaching the teachers" since age six. For the last 8 years in private practice they've been the therapist's coach, the healer's metaphysician, the educator's map-maker, and the spaceholder's respite. Their people are earnest learners, deep divers, truth tellers, giant hearts in person-shaped outerwear who are enthusiastically ready to fall in love continuously with being a human being. Jacey designs bespoke apprenticeship style immersive 1-1 and group programs as spaces for discovery, development, and coming home. As a survivor, complexity nerd, and giant heart-person, they have an unwavering commitment to/obsession with the truth, the juice of what actually works moment to moment, piercing through abstractions, oversimplifications, siloed disciplines, and empty protocols to the raw, alive beating drum of phenomena itself. They've trained in 25+ healing, expressive arts, and developmental approaches in the last 11 years, are credentialed as a Professional Certified Coach (PCC) with the ICF via The Institute for Coaching Mastery, as an Aston-Patterning Movement and Bodywork Practitioner, began training with generative somatics in 2017, studied Bodynamic Developmental Somatic Psychotherapy, and regularly practice expressive arts, contact improv, and authentic relating. Over the past year, Jacey has re-homed their private somatic coaching practice into a web of nurturing collaborations rooted in deep friendships that nourish their heart and inspire their soul 💜 They wholeheartedly believe we can be each other's medicine.
