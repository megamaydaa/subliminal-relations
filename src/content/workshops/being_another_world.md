## Being Another World: a path back to somatic solidarity

Let’s imagine that each of us is a world, both singular and deeply related by rhythms of learning and growing in a shared context. Through differentiation and mutual curiosity we learn the subtle art of bringing our world into relationship with others. But there is risk involved, how to balance a longing for unity, a pull towards agency, and a shared cultural context that strips us of collective power through overt and covert violence? Drawing inspiration from developmental theory, embodied healing principles and radical pedagogy, Being Another World is an adaptive container for exploring the relational dance between inner and inter relationship, and its interruptions. 

Over the course of six weeks we will explore six themes: (1) Ground, (2) Reciprocity, (3) Agency, (4) Rupture and Repair, (5) Rage and Grief and (6) Somatic Solidarity. Each week will be an opportunity to explore the contradictions between our genuine connection to these themes and the social conditions that get in the way of deepening into them relationally. The themes will weave through and deepen throughout the six session flow, to build awareness through layers of experience. 

Each 2-hour session will introduce experiential exercises drawn from principles of body based healing practices, theater games, and improvised movement. Through a rhythm of embodied practice and conversation in dyads and the group as a whole, we will build awareness of our felt sense as individuals and as a relational field.  Week six will conclude with an integrative, low-stakes show and tell as an expression of relational culture for another world. 

The core themes are starting points based on our training and lived experience and we expect the content in each session to shift and change alongside the lived experience of the group.  The level of intimacy and vulnerability will also be shaped by the group in real time, and situated within the larger process of co-creating an adaptive container to hold an expansive collective aliveness. This workshop series is just one of many experiments, searching for a path back to a felt-sense of interdependence in this historical moment.

- Simple practices that you can bring to your social world to continue the work of building collective agency after the workshop.
