## Being Another World: a path back to somatic solidarity

At this historical moment there is a felt sense gaining momentum as the shadow side of the overculture turns belly up; a felt sense that relational culture is a spark that can never be extinguished from embodied memory. Being Another World is an invitation to honor, play with, and amplify spark into flame.

We invite you into an adaptive container for sensing the contradictions between our inherent embodied connection to one another and the social conditions that have gotten in the way. Our dream for this workshop is to cultivate a relational field where principles of embodied healing can be experienced, not as a trademarked modality, strict protocol, or professional development pathway (though that is welcome), but as a relational ground for awareness, creative expression and building collective power. We are life-long students of self-healing life processes known by many names, accessed and mapped through diverse cultural processes. We have arrived at this offering through years of formal and informal training in body-oriented healing modalities (generative somatics, Focusing, Aston Patterning, Bodynamics, NARM), developmental theory, social neuroscience, and lived experience of extreme distress states.

Together, we will explore six relational-developmental themes: (1) Ground, (2) Reciprocity, (3) Agency, (4) Rupture and Repair, (5) Rage and Grief and (6) Somatic Solidarity. Each week we will facilitate theater games, movement scores, and awareness practices that support the development of embodied listening. Along the way, we will build new layers of support into our co-created relational field as we deepen our inquiry. Ground will focus on arriving in re-connection to the earth through play and meditation; Reciprocity will deepen into this relationship with ground, while introducing partner practices that generate a felt-sense of interpersonal support; Agency will build on that potential for interpersonal support while honoring boundary and differentiation through movement scores; Rupture and Repair deepens our reflection on where sources of support may have gone missing and provides opportunities for politicized reflection and inner relational repair; Rage and Grief builds on the ground of the preceding weeks, inviting us into a  theatrical expression of agency as a practice of sensorimotor wholeness and genuine reflection; Somatic Solidarity will be an opportunity to slow everything down and reflect on the learning we will bring to the world outside the container through our embodiment. Participants will be asked to keep an integration “journal,” which can take any form - from sketchbook to spreadsheet to recipe to sheet music. Week six will conclude with an integrative, low-stakes show and tell drawn from this journaling, as a form of culture building towards another world.

The core themes are starting points and we expect the content in each session to shift and change alongside the lived experience of the group. The level of intimacy and vulnerability will also be shaped by the group in real time, and situated within the larger process of co-creating an adaptive container to hold an expansive collective aliveness.
