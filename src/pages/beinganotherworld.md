Being Another World: a path back to somatic solidarity

Science and wisdom agree that we are sensing, simulating and responding to one another somatically all the time. This nonverbal communication is how we learn as babies, and it continues to inform how we approach relationships as we change and grow. Bringing this implicit sensing into awareness is the premise of most somatic healing modalities, though most somatic healing modalities don’t recognize the contribution of the social conditions to this process. Being Another World is a learning and healing circle dedicated to building resilience against the colonial lie of disconnection from our bodies, the wider living world and one another. 

Over the course of six weeks we will explore six themes: (1) Agency, (2) Reciprocity, (3) Feelings, (4) Rupture, Humility and Repair, (5) Rage, Grief and Opening and (6) Somatic Solidarity. These core themes are starting points based on our training and lived experience, and we expect them to shift and change alongside the lived experience of the group. The level of intimacy and vulnerability will also be shaped by the group in real time, and situated within the larger process of co-creating an adaptive container to hold the collective aliveness that narrowly defined social conditions deny. 

Each 2-hour bi-weekly session will begin with relational exercises and experiments drawn from somatic therapy techniques and theater games, followed by circle discussions to connect implicit embodied insights with conscious awareness. These in person weeks will be supplemented with reading materials and opportunities for further discussion on a dedicated Discord channel. Week six will conclude with an integrative, low-stakes show and tell as an expression of agency and relational culture for another world. 



This is not really a professional skills building class except in the sense that your own embodiment is the start of changes in your personal life that will translate to client work (and exercises are transferable :) – We care about nurturing your embodiment as the first step in your work as a helping professional

To create a greater sense of availability, flexibility, courage and internal space for inner and inter-relationship.

To help your body remember the felt-sense of belonging to something bigger than the current status quo. 

To introduce practices that you can bring to your social world to continue the work of building collective agency after the workshop.

To bring you principles rather than playbook that you can creatively expand upon in ongoing somatic trainings, and that support your internal change work as a person and/or helping professional. 

To introduce you to a constellation of thinkers and practitioners that can support your ongoing, deepening explorations.
