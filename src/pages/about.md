I come to the healing arts with a background in performance and video. My own mental-emotional challenges led me to ask questions outside the scope of "mental illness," and connected me to somatic modalities and intergenerational healing. These non-linear approaches to distress have allowed me to connect my creative skillset more intimately to the interpersonal processes that have always been my passion.   

I am currently training to become a somatic psychotherapist, but Relational Embodiment Healing is my effort to create a non-clincal, non-pathologizing container. I incorporate modalities, some of which are clinical, that feel philosophically and politically aligned with a decolonial anticapitalist practice. 

I am deeply commited to collective healing and run a workshop called "What is a Collective Nervous System?" regularly. I also collaborate on several popular education projects that make psychotheraputic theories more accessible and occassionally publish zines like this one.
