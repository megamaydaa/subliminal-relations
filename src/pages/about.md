My name is Megan Daalder, formerly known as primordial futures :). 

I am currently between graduate psychology programs, looking to create a container where healing can take place non-clinically. I incorporate modalities, some of which are clinical, that feel philosophically and politically aligned with a decolonial anticapitalist practice.
