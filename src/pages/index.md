## Relational Embodiment Healing

In Relational Embodiment Healing, we orient to what you're longing for and learn to dialogue with what gets in the way. We will move at your pace to open channels of communication between mind, body, and spirit to relieve the inner pressure that builds when we lose connection with ourselves and our inherent belonging with life.

I incorporate modalities that help restore the balance between relationship and agency. These include the Neuroaffective Relational Model (NARM) for working with relational trauma, Inner Relationship Focusing, generative somatics, theater and dance practices, and Intentional Peer Support. I come with the wisdom of my own lived experience of madness and practice a non-pathologizing approach to emotional health. I am being mentored by Dr. Rae Johnson.
