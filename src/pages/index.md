## Relational Embodiment Coaching

In Relational Embodiment Coaching we work together to uncover what you're longing for and move through what gets in the way. Cultivating presence with the body is a process that can be joyful, surprising, sorrowful, and integrative. Ultimately, it is a process of re-connection to a sense of inherent belonging with life. 

I incorporate modalities that help restore the balance between relationship and agency. These include the Neuroaffective Relational Model (NARM) for working with relational trauma, Inner Relationship Focusing, generative somatics embodiment coaching, and Intentional Peer Support. I come with the wisdom of my own lived experience of madness and practice a non-pathologizing approach to mental health. I am being mentored by Dr. Rae Johnson. 

Sessions are sliding scale 40-75 for 60 minutes

I'm trained to work within a 10 session "arc of transformation." You can choose how much structure you would like for the work.

## What I can promise

I can not promise to relieve all of your symptoms of anxiety and depression and I am not yet experienced enough to work on serious trauma resolution; however I can promise, based on my own personal experience and study, that relational somatic work can relieve some of the inner pressure that builds when we lose connection with ourselves and our inherent belonging. By including the body in dialogue around these pressures, and exploring tension patterns in the body, you will organically move towards a new, more empowered shape.
