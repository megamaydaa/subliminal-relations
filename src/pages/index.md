## Relational Embodiment Coaching

In Relational Embodiment Coaching I offer myself as a mirror for working through the inner and outter relationships that make you you. We collaborate to uncover what you're longing for and what gets in the way. In the process you will make contact with and learn from the interpersonal, social and environmental relations that have shaped you, and rediscover your agency to shape them back.

I incorporate modalities that help restore the balance between relationship and agency. These include the Neuroaffective Relational Model (NARM) for working with relational trauma, Inner Relationship Focusing, generative somatics embodiment coaching, and trauma informed peer support. I come with the wisdom of my own lived experience of madness and view the work as a co-learning process with you at the center and me as a companion. I am being mentored by Dr. Rae Johnson. 

Sessions are sliding scale 40-75 for 60 minutes

I'm trained to work within a 10 session "arc of transformation." You can choose how much structure you would like for the work.

## What I can promise

I can not promise to relieve all of your symptoms of anxiety and depression and I am not yet experienced enough to work on serious trauma resolution; however I can promise, based on my own personal experience and study, that relational somatic work can relieve some of the inner pressure that builds when we lose connection with ourselves and our inherent belonging. By including the body in dialogue around these pressures, and exploring tension patterns in the body, you will organically move towards a new, more empowered shape.
