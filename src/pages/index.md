## 1-on-1 Relational Embodiment Healing
- **feeling ourselves is a danger to those who benefit from us staying numb

In Relational Embodiment Healing, we orient to what you're longing for and learn to dialogue with what gets in the way. We move at your pace to open channels of communication between past, present and future by developing fluency in the body's language of images, sensations and emotions. Through an exploratory process of re-connection, our work together will help relieve the inner pressure that builds when we lose connection with ourselves and our inherent belonging with life.

I incorporate modalities that help restore the balance between relationship and agency. These include the generative somatics/Strozzi arc of transformation, Inner Relationship Focusing parts work, and the Neuroaffective Relational Model (NARM) for working through disembodiment picked up in the family of origin and reinforced by social conditions in the dominant culture.
