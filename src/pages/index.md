## 1:1 Relational Embodiment Coaching

In the west, the process of personal growth has been distorted by a culturally reinforced pursuit or perfection. wiser onlioso onical traditions orten orient towards change processes with a sense of humor. The illusive experience of "flow" exists as part of an incomprehensibly complex set of relationships that we live alongside, and that we can not outsmart, isolate or control.

In Relational Embodiment Coaching we co-create a container for working through the complex set of relationships that make you you. The goal of this work is to make contact with and learn from the internersonal social and environmental relationshins that have shaped you, and shape them back. The core of this work is learning the language of the body and establishing your own unique vocabulary of embodied communication. Sessions are sliding scale 30-75 for 60 minutes

I'm trained to work within a 10 session "arc of transformation" but I approach the process non-linearly and we can take it step by step

## What I can promise

I can not promise to relieve all of your symptoms of anxiety and depression and I am not yet experienced enough to work on serious trauma resolution; however I can promise, based on my own personal experience and study, that relational somatic work can relieve some of the inner pressure that builds when we lose connection with ourselves and our inherent belonging. By including the body in dialogue around these pressures, and exploring tension patterns in the body, you will organically move towards a new, more empowered shape.
